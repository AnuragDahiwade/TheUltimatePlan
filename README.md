- ## How to Learn Better and Faster as a Software Engineer
    - Register your curiocity. (Make and entry in your favorite notetaking app, and more inportantly write why you wanted to read and learn about it.)
      - make a note of it
      - write why you are curious about it
      - revisit whenever you want, when you have time.
    - JumpStart
      - start right now.
      - pick any resourse and just start doing the things.
      - start with anything you have.
    - Do the Laundry
      - when you get the idea just start doing the things.
      - start coding the things out.
      - don't just read and read and read, Go and Implement it.
    - Inverser Power Law
      - spend more time preparing the basecs and don't get intriged by the advance topics.
      - focus on fundamentals then jump to the advanced part.
    - Juggle and TimeBox
      - we underestimate how we can do in parallel.
      - Pick two or things that you want to learn in parallel and when you get bored of one thing jump on the the other thing and do that.
      - Do justice to the your decision of starting to learn this.
      - Timebox the things give enough time(1 or 2 months) and then take a call that you want to learn it further or not.
